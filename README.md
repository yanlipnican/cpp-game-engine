# 2D/3D engine

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yanlipnican/cpp-game-engine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yanlipnican/cpp-game-engine)

## Current state

Engine is not ready for production use yet. Currently i am working on high speed 2D instanced renderer for 2D games and UI.

## Roadmap
* Near
  * Finish up 2D rendering
  * 2D sprite animation
  * Sound
  * Scripting
  * 3D rendering
* Ultra-far
  * Visual tools for engine (Scene editor, lights, scripts, etc.)

## Development

I am developing under Linux (Ubuntu 16.04). Currently MacOS build is not working due some namespace errors and Windows is not tested yet.

### Build and run project
1. run ```./run deps``` - installs dependecies
2. run ```./run prepare``` - compiles cmake project
3. run ```./run build```
4. run ```./run start```
